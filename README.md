## 🧠 WHOAMI

I’m **Zox**, a developer with **6+ years of hands-on web development experience**, focused on building **clean, scalable, and performant systems**.

I enjoy working closely with both **frontend and backend**, designing systems that are not only functional, but also maintainable, predictable, and future-proof.

I’m a **Co-Founder of Orbit Studios**, where quality is non-negotiable. I actively maintain and refine my resources and repositories until they meet my own high standards, not just technically, but from a **user and customer perspective** as well.

Customer satisfaction is a top priority for me. I value clear communication, reliability, and long-term trust, and I approach every project with the goal of delivering something I would confidently use or ship myself.

Currently:
- 🚀 **Co-Founder @ Orbit Studios**
- ⚙️ Building web apps, FiveM resources, APIs, Discord bots, personal projects, and more
- 🧩 Strong focus on architecture, UX, DX, and performance
